ValueFlow: Universal IP Revenue Sharing System
Transforming Intellectual Property from Scarcity to Abundance 

PRIOR ART DISCLOSURE - AUGUST 29, 2025, 11:45 PM CEST (Stockholm)

Executive Summary

The current intellectual property system creates artificial scarcity through restrictive licensing, unused patent portfolios, and gatekeeping mechanisms that stifle innovation. This document proposes ValueFlow, a Universal IP Revenue Sharing System that enables automatic or semi-automatic value sharing between original IP holders and IP reusers, designed to reduce or eliminate licensing barriers while ensuring fair compensation for all participants in the innovation ecosystem.

This disclosure describes core concepts and multiple non-limiting implementation approaches, including various allocation models (such as equal splits, configurable ratios, multi-party distributions, and dynamic formulas), diverse settlement mechanisms (real-time, batch, escrow, clearinghouse, etc.), and multiple technological and governance options (centralized, federated, hybrid, and decentralized).

For the complete specification including definitions, implementation variants, edge cases, and technical architecture details, see universal_ip_system.md.
