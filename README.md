PRIOR ART DISCLOSURE - AUGUST 29, 2025, 11:45 PM CEST (Stockholm)

Executive Summary

The current intellectual property system creates artificial scarcity through restrictive licensing, unused patent portfolios, and gatekeeping
mechanisms that stifle innovation. This document proposes ValueFlow, a Universal IP Revenue Sharing System that automatically splits value 50/50
between original IP holders and IP reusers, eliminating licensing barriers while ensuring fair compensation for all participants in the innovation ecosystem.
