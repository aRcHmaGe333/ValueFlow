# ALL RIGHTS RESERVED — AUTHORSHIP & PATENT CLAIM LICENSE
# with VALUEFLOW UNIVERSAL ACCESS

**APC-VF License v2.0 — February 2026**

---

## PREAMBLE

This license establishes two things simultaneously.

First, it claims complete ownership of this Work by right of first public disclosure, with cryptographic proof of authorship and date. Second, it grants universal access to use the Work, on the condition that any revenue generated from its use is shared with the Author.

The result is a Work that is fully owned and fully accessible. The Author is compensated. The world benefits. Nothing sits unused behind a locked door.

## PART ONE: AUTHORSHIP & PATENT CLAIM

### I. Declaration of Authorship

**Author:** Slavko Stojnić

All files, ideas, methods, systems, processes, algorithms, architectures, designs, and functional content contained in this repository, project, or body of work (the "Work") are the original creation of the Author.

### II. Patent Claim by Public Record

This publication constitutes a public, timestamped, cryptographically verifiable patent claim over the Work as a whole.

| Proof Layer | Value |
|---|---|
| **Merkle Root / Git Tree Hash** | `415765ade25f03e09806857740c98d170cc19469` |
| **RFC 3161 Timestamp Token** | `.timestamps/415765ade25f03e09806857740c98d170cc19469.tsr` |
| **Redundant Timestamp** | `.timestamps/415765ade25f03e09806857740c98d170cc19469.ots` |
| **Date of First Publication** | `2026-02-26 UTC` |

The Merkle root is a single cryptographic hash derived from the combined hashes of every file in this Work. A change to any file produces a different root. The root proves the integrity of the Work as an indivisible unit.

The RFC 3161 timestamp token binds this root to a verified date and time, signed by an independent Time Stamping Authority. It is verifiable by anyone using OpenSSL. See `VERIFY.md` for instructions.

No prior public record of this Work exists. The Author published first.

### III. Scope of Claim

The Author is not a lawyer and does not employ researchers to search the world's archives for overlaps between this Work and prior claims.

Accordingly:

Every element of the Work that is patentable — under any jurisdiction, in any category, by any present or future standard — is claimed as the Author's patent by right of first public disclosure.

Every element of the Work that is not patentable — for any reason, under any law, in any jurisdiction — is not claimed as a patent. It remains the Author's original work, protected by copyright and by the authorship claim established in this license.

If any element that is not currently patentable becomes patentable in the future — through changes in law, the emergence of new jurisdictions, or the creation of new intellectual property categories — this disclosure constitutes a claim over that element as of the original publication date. The timestamp proves the Author disclosed it first. Future patentability does not alter who created it or when.

No prior art search was conducted. None was necessary. The Author created this Work, published it first, and claims everything the law permits.

### IV. Prior Art Defense

This publication establishes irrevocable prior art. Any third-party attempt to file a patent or intellectual property claim over any concept, method, or system described in this Work is subject to invalidation by this public record of prior disclosure.

### V. Duration

This license does not expire. There are no renewal fees, maintenance payments, or lapse conditions. The claim persists for as long as the public record is accessible.

## PART TWO: VALUEFLOW UNIVERSAL ACCESS

### VI. Grant of Use

Despite the all-rights-reserved status declared in Part One, the Author grants universal, worldwide, perpetual access to use, implement, manufacture, adapt, and build upon the Work, subject to the conditions in this Part.

Any party that generates revenue from the use of this Work, or from any derivative of this Work, must compensate the Author according to the pricing model declared below.

### VII. Pricing Model

The Author declares the cost of using this Work by selecting one or more of the following models. Different use cases may carry different pricing.

#### Model A: Fixed Minimum Per Unit

The Author declares a minimum cost per unit produced, per instance deployed, or per transaction completed — as appropriate to the nature of the Work. There is no maximum. Compensation scales linearly with the number of units.

| Use Case | Minimum Per Unit |
|---|---|
| `[describe application]` | `[amount and currency]` |
| `[describe application]` | `[amount and currency]` |

The minimum is a floor. The user may pay above it. The Author does not negotiate it downward.

#### Model B: Revenue Share

The Author declares a percentage of gross revenue owed per transaction, sale, subscription, or other revenue event derived from the Work or any derivative.

| Share | Percentage |
|---|---|
| Author | `[__]%` |
| User | `[__]%` |

If no percentage is declared, the default is 50/50.

Revenue share is calculated on **net profit**: the amount remaining after the user's verified costs of production, materials, labor, distribution, and delivery are deducted from the sale price. Taxes owed to governments are also excluded, as they are not retained by either party.

The user's pre-use declaration (Section VIII) establishes the projected cost structure before production begins. This projection serves as the audit baseline. If the user's reported costs at settlement diverge materially from the declared projections without documented justification, the Author may treat the discrepancy as a breach of the declaration and pursue remedies under Section XV.

The Author's share is a share of the value the user actually captured — not of the user's total receipts before the cost of doing business.

#### Model C: Hybrid

The Author may assign different models to different use cases. Any combination of Model A and Model B is valid, including free access for specified categories (see Section XII).

### VIII. Pre-Use Declaration

Before manufacturing, deploying, or commercializing any product or service that incorporates this Work, the user must submit a written declaration stating:

1. Which APC-VF licensed works are incorporated, identified by repository URL or claim ID.
2. The intended use case, corresponding to an entry in the pricing table above.
3. The user's projected cost structure for the product or service: materials, labor, services, distribution, and intended unit price or service fee.

This declaration constitutes the contract between the user and the Author. It is completed and signed before production begins. The user is responsible for determining whether the product is commercially viable given the Author's stated terms.

### IX. Contract Duration and Price Adjustment

Each pre-use declaration is valid for a fixed term declared by the Author. If no term is specified, the default is 12 months from the date of the declaration.

During the active term, the pricing stated in the declaration is locked. The Author cannot alter the price, revoke the grant, or impose new conditions on an active contract. The user's production, deployment, and commercialization proceed under the terms they agreed to.

The Author may adjust pricing at any time, but adjusted pricing applies only to:

1. New pre-use declarations submitted after the adjustment is published.
2. Existing declarations upon renewal, after the current term expires.

The Author must publish any price adjustment no fewer than 90 days before the earliest affected renewal date. The publication must be in the same location as the original pricing declaration — the repository, the license file, or the ValueFlow protocol registry.

Upon renewal, the user reviews the updated terms and either accepts them (continuing production under new pricing) or declines (ceasing use of the Work within a 90-day wind-down period after the term expires). No response within 30 days of the renewal date constitutes acceptance of the new terms.

The Author may not adjust pricing retroactively. The Author may not adjust pricing more than once per contract term. These constraints exist to protect the user's ability to plan, produce, and operate without disruption.

### X. ValueFlow Protocol

The pre-use declaration, pricing lookup, contract state, renewal notifications, and price adjustment publishing described in this license are administered through the ValueFlow protocol — a system that automates the exchange of structured information between Authors and users.

The protocol handles:

1. Registration of APC-VF licensed works and their pricing tables.
2. Submission and acknowledgment of pre-use declarations.
3. Contract state tracking: active term, renewal date, current pricing.
4. Notification of price adjustments to affected users within the required lead time.
5. Settlement reporting and payment reconciliation.

The protocol's technical specification and reference implementation are maintained separately from this license. See the ValueFlow repository for the current specification.

Where the protocol is not yet available or not adopted by both parties, the obligations in this license are fulfilled manually: declarations in writing, adjustments published in the repository, notifications by any verifiable written channel.

### XI. Multi-Patent Products

When a product incorporates works from multiple Authors, each under APC-VF, each Author's declared cost is independent and additive. The total intellectual property cost of the product is the sum of all applicable Authors' terms.

The pre-use declaration must list every APC-VF licensed work used in the product. This list serves as attribution, as an auditable record linking revenue to the Authors who made it possible, and as a public ledger of which intellectual contributions underlie the product.

### XII. Non-Revenue Use

Use of the Work that generates no revenue — including personal use, education, academic research, and non-commercial experimentation — is permitted without charge, provided the user includes attribution as specified in Section XIII. Revenue-generating use activates the pricing model immediately upon the first revenue event.

---

## PART THREE: TERMS AND ENFORCEMENT

### XIII. Attribution

Every use of the Work or any derivative must include clear attribution to the Author:

1. The Author's name or designated identifier.
2. A link to the original repository or publication.
3. A statement that the work is used under APC-VF License v2.0.

Removal or concealment of attribution voids the grant of use under Part Two and converts continued use into infringement under Part One.

### XIV. Settlement

Payments may be settled through any mechanism agreed between the Author and user, including direct transfer, payment platform integration, periodic batch settlement, automated point-of-sale splitting, or programmatic contract execution.

In the absence of an explicit agreement, the user must report usage and revenue quarterly and settle within 30 days of each report.

### XV. Infringement

The blanket patent claim in Section III and the pre-use declaration requirement in Section VIII together eliminate the need for either party to conduct prior art searches, hunt for infringers, or preemptively litigate.

If a product uses this Work commercially without a pre-use declaration, the infringement is established by the absence of a declaration against the public record of the Author's claim. The evidence is already assembled: the Author's timestamp, the product's existence, and the missing declaration.

The Author is not obligated to enforce. If the Author chooses to enforce, the Author reserves all legal remedies available under applicable law in any jurisdiction. The Author also reserves the right to publicly identify the infringement and to revoke the ValueFlow grant for specific parties, converting their status to unauthorized use under Part One.

### XVI. Submission as Consent

If this Work was registered through a timestamping or bundling service, the act of submission constituted the Author's consent to hash, timestamp, and license the content under the terms of this license.

### XVII. The Duty Clause

This Work is published because optimal solutions, once they exist, must be available wherever the problems they solve exist. No product should rely on a suboptimal design when an optimal one has been disclosed. No process should generate avoidable waste when a more efficient one is available.

The ValueFlow grant exists to remove the barrier between a disclosed solution and its application, while ensuring the Author is compensated for the contribution that made the application possible.

### XVIII. Transparent Pricing

All pricing declared under this license is public by design. As adoption grows, the declared terms for comparable works across Authors, industries, and jurisdictions become observable and comparable.

Authors setting their pricing may reference established rates for similar contributions. Users evaluating whether to adopt a Work may compare the Author's terms against observable standards in their field. Where the compensation claimed by any party — Author or user — is disproportionate to the value delivered, the transparency of the public record makes that disproportion visible to anyone with an interest in the outcome.

No central authority administers this process. The correction is structural: published terms are visible, comparable, and open to informed scrutiny.

### XIX. Severability

If any provision of this license is found unenforceable in a given jurisdiction, all remaining provisions remain in full effect.

### XX. Acceptance

By accessing, using, implementing, or building upon the Work, you accept the terms of this license in full: the authorship claim, the revenue-sharing obligation, the attribution requirement, and the pre-use declaration obligation.
